Contributor Introduction
============================================================================

We would love for you to contribute to Vertizee and help make it even better.
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - `Question or Problem?`_
 - `Found a Bug?`_
 - `Missing a Feature?`_
 - `Submitting an Issue`_
 - `Submitting a Pull Request (PR)`_


Question or Problem?
================================

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vertizee>`_
to ask support-related questions. When creating a new question on Stack Overflow, make sure to add
the ``vertizee`` tag.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question/answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible


Found a Bug?
================================

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by `submitting an issue <https://github.com/cpeisert/vertizee/issues>`_ to our
`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/cpeisert/vertizee>`_. Even better, you can :ref:`submit a Pull Request <section-submit-pull-request>` with a fix.


Missing a Feature?
================================
You can *request* a new feature by `submitting an issue <https://github.com/cpeisert/vertizee/issues>`_ to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to
determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you
  to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly :ref:`submitted as a Pull Request <section-submit-pull-request>`.


Submitting an Issue
================================


Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already
exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it.
Having a *minimal reproducible scenario* gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth with additional questions.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our `new issue templates <https://github.com/cpeisert/vertizee/issues/new/choose>`_ and filling out the issue template.


.. _section-submit-pull-request:

Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
================================

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search `GitHub <https://github.com/cpeisert/vertizee/pulls>`_ for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you are fixing, or documents the design for the feature you would like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we are ready to accept your work.

3. To prepare your contribution, follow the instructions in the :doc:`Contributor Guide <contributor_guide>`.
