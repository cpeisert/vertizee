    abstract = {If you had to buy just one text on algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms is a magnificent choice. The book begins by considering the mathematical foundations of the analysis of algorithms and maintains this mathematical rigor throughout the work. The tools developed in these opening sections are then applied to sorting, data structures, graphs, and a variety of selected algorithms including computational geometry, string algorithms, parallel models of computation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and more. This book's strength lies in its encyclopedic range, clear exposition, and powerful analysis. Pseudo-code explanation of the algorithms coupled with proof of their accuracy makes this book is a great resource on the basic tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms.}

    abstract = {Susanna Epp's Discrete Mathematics with Applications, Fourth Edition provides a clear introduction to discrete mathematics. Renowned for her lucid, accessible prose, Epp explains complex, abstract concepts with clarity and precision. This book presents not only the major themes of discrete mathematics, but also the reasoning that underlies mathematical thought. Students develop the ability to think abstractly as they study the ideas of logic and proof. While learning about such concepts as logic circuits and computer addition, algorithm analysis, recursive thinking, computability, automata, cryptography, and combinatorics, students discover that the ideas of discrete mathematics underlie and are essential to the science and technology of the computer age. Overall, Epp's emphasis on reasoning provides students with a strong foundation for computer science and upper-level mathematics courses.}

    doi = {10.1145/28869.28874},
    abstract = {In this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). Our structure, Fibonacci heaps (abbreviated F-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph: O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n);  O(mβ(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where β(m, n) = min {i | log(i)n ≤ m/n}. Note that β(m, n) ≤ log*n if m ≥ n.  Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.},
