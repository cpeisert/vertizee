# Vertizee
Vertizee is a typed, object-oriented graph library for Python 3.5+.

Vertizee includes many of the greatest-hits graph theory algorithms as well as implementations of
various data structures such as BK Tree, Fibonacci Heap, Priority Queue, and Union Find (a.k.a.
Disjoint Set).

The algorithms are a work in progress and contributions are welcome.
