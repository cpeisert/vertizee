"""Data types supporting directed and undirected graph edges.

* :class:`Edge <vertizee.classes.edge.Edge>` - An undirected connection between two vertices.
  The order of the vertices does not matter. However, the string representation will always
  print vertices sorted in lexicographic order.
* :class:`DiEdge <vertizee.classes.edge.DiEdge>` - A directed connection between two vertices that
  defines the ``tail`` as the starting vertex and the ``head`` as the destination vertex.
* :class:`EdgeType` - A type alias for the union of the edge classes: ``Union[DiEdge, Edge]``

    """Edge is a graph primitive that represents an undirected connection between two vertices.

    To ensure the integrity of graphs, edges should never be initialized directly. Attempting
    to initialize an edge using its ``__init__`` method will raise an error. To create edges, use
    :class:`GraphBase <vertizee.classes.graph_base.GraphBase>` methods such as
    :meth:`GraphBase.add_edge <vertizee.classes.graph_base.GraphBase.add_edge>`.

    Edges may be assigned a weight as well as custom attributes using the :attr:`attr` dictionary.

    Note:
        Directed graphs use the subclass :class:`DiEdge`, which provides ``tail`` and ``head``
        Vertex properties.

    Note:
        If multiple edges are added with the same vertices, then a single ``Edge`` instance
        is used to store the parallel edges. When working with edges, use the
        ``parallel_edge_count`` property to determine if the edge represents more than one edge
        connection. Edges represented by vertex pairs :math:`(a, b)` and :math:`(b, a)` map to the
        same ``Edge`` object in undirected graphs, but different ``DiEdge`` objects in directed
        graphs.

    Note:
        When new edges are created, the incident edge lists for each ``Vertex`` object are updated
        with references to the new edge. This process is handled automatically as long as vertices
        and edges are initialized using the ``GraphBase`` API (e.g. :meth:`GraphBase.add_edge
        <vertizee.classes.graph_base.GraphBase.add_edge>` and :meth:`GraphBase.add_vertex
        <vertizee.classes.graph_base.GraphBase.add_vertex>`).
