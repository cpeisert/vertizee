    """Edge is a graph primitive that represents an undirected connection between two vertices.

    To ensure the integrity of graphs, edges should never be initialized directly. Attempting
    to initialize an edge using its `__init__` method will raise an error. To create edges, use
    GraphBase methods such as `add_edge`.

    Edges may be assigned a weight as well as custom attributes. This class supports both
    directed and undirected edges. However, directed graphs use the subclass DiEdge, which provides
    tail and head Vertex properties.

    IMPORTANT: If multiple edges are added with the same vertices, then a single `Edge` instance
    is used to store the parallel edges. When working with edges, use the `parallel_edge_count`
    property to determine if the edge represents more than one edge connection. Edges represented
    by vertex pairs (a, b) and (b, a) map to the same Edge object in undirected graphs, but
    different Edge objects in directed graphs.

    Args:
        v1: The first vertex (the order does not matter, since this is an
            undirected edge).
        v2: The second vertex.
        weight: Optional; Edge weight. Defaults to 1.
        parallel_edge_count: Optional; The number of parallel edges from vertex1 to vertex2.
            Defaults to 0.
        parallel_edge_weights: Optional; List of weights for the parallel edges.
            Defaults to None.

    Note:
        When new edges are created, the incident edge lists for each Vertex object are updated
        with references to the new edge. This process is handled automatically as long as vertices
        and edges are not initialized outside of the `GraphBase` API.
